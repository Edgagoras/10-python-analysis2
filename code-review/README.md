## Code Review

The code review task this week will involve reviewing the code of one of
your peer's assignment notebooks to see which kind of model they implemented
and the extent to which they were successful. Assignments this week involved 
executing an example pymc3 analysis based on simulated data, and was meant to
include the use of `numpy.random` to simulate data, and the use of `pymc3` 
to fit the data using an example from the pymc3 tutorials.

## Review instructions

1. Find the notebook that you are assigned to review in the Code-Review-Map 
below. If your assigned notebook is not available by the time you go to do your
review then choose any notebook in the GitHub repository. 

2. Create a new notebook in the Code-Review directory and name it
`<github-username-code-review-10.ipynb`. Use this notebook to test out the 
code that you are assigned to review, and use markdown to answer the questions
below. 

3. What method did they use to generate data? What types of distributions 
did they sample data from? What type of data do these distributions generate?


4. What type of model did they try to fit with pymc3? Did they link to the 
tutorial that their analysis is based on. Which parameters of the model are 
they trying to fit. 

5. Are they sampling data in their model from the same type of distribution 
that was used to generate the data?

6. Do you agree or disagree with their assessment of the model fit? Did it 
work well? How might you suggest improving the model, or further testing this
type of model?

7. Commit and push your notebook to the Code Review directory and make a pull
request with the course repository.
