    "#### They created a model that was similar to the notebook 10.6 example. The model they created, seedling_model, estimated the switchpoint when the rate of seedlings per year changed. To do this, the model estimated the parameters early rate and late rate. Early_rate was related to the rate of seedlings before the switchpoint and late_rate was particular to the rate of seedlings after the switchpoint. The model was also trying to estimate when the switchpoint actually occured. "

    "#### Q. Do you agree of disagreee with their assessment of the model fit? Did it work well? How might you suggest improving the model, or further testing this type of model?\n",
    "#### Their model predicted the switchpoint as being a date that was 17 years after the actual switchpoint, it also has a sd of 21.48. While this value is close to the date of the switchpoint, I think it could have been more accurate if they had run more than 100 iterations. They did awknowledge this in their assessment and explained why they did so few iterations. If possible, I would suggest running the sampler over a larger number of iterations. In addition, they ask the model to search for the switch point around 1800, when their switchpoint was actually around 1600. So I might also change it to see if that improves their model assessment at all. "
