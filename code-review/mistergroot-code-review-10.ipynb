    "Jess did not provide an assessment of the model fit but I think the model got close to the actual switchpoint and the early and late rate. The only issue is the number of datapoints that were generated and the very short run of the MCMC chain. Jess ran her chain with only 10 steps and disposed of 3 of the steps when running trace. This means that the switchpoint and early and late rate have a quite large confidence interval (e.g. 95% CI of switchpoint is (13,16) which doesn't seem that large but when you consider that the number of years was only 25, it is quite a large CI) and the models are not fit very well. Jess did all the right steps but the model could have been made more accurate by generating a larger initial dataset and running the MCMC for many more steps."
