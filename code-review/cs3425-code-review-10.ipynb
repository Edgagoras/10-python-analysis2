I think the creation of the model looks good to me compared to the documentation sample code, so I'm not sure where the traces and coefficient transformation went wrong but those looked like two sources of issues. (Maybe the traceplots went wrong first, although it looks identical to the sample code?) This could be on me not misunderstanding, but comparing it to the sample code the results look different (i.e., the sample code does estimate the parameters that were defined in the DataFrame)."
